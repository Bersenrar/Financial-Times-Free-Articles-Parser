/content/55ebb044-3d37-42d1-836c-bc9c2430529d	Unspoilt Italy – the best independent hotels in the Mezzogiorno	<p>News item: the small military airport in Salerno, 45 miles south of Naples, reopened not long ago as <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.aeroportosalerno.it/en/home">Salerno Costa d’Amalfi and Cilento Airport</a>. This arrival has been treated as a boon for the lower half of the Amalfi Coast; among the flurry of commercial airlines to offer flights this summer is British Airways, three times a week from Gatwick.</p><p>But the real headline, to my mind, should be the access Salerno now provides to everything below it. Southern Campania, Basilicata, Calabria and Puglia are all prime road-tripping (and whisper it, less saturated) destinations, connecting with ease and offering landscapes of alternating severe and serene beauty.</p><p>No single big luxury hospitality brand has yet got a toehold down here. Though it’s only a matter of time – particularly in Puglia, where Four Seasons has already tapped a massive plot on the Adriatic. Instead, the region is marked by some of the best little hotels in the Mezzogiorno. Two are ancestral family homes; only some have restaurants, and not one of them has a lift (your knees have been warned). But each in its way is an antidote to the high-spec sameness that is becoming the all-too-predictable language of luxury abroad.</p><hr/><p><a data-trackable="link" href="https://palazzobelmonte.com/en/">Palazzo Belmonte</a> is in the seaside village of Santa Maria di Castellabate, a 50-minute drive south from Salerno. The Cilento Coast, Campania’s anti-Amalfi, shares little of the glamour that prevails to the north, but enjoys a wilder version of its beauty. I first stayed at this hotel 18 years ago; it was run then by Prince Angelo Granito Pignatelli di Belmonte, whose family built the palazzo in the early 17th century. These days his daughters Francesca and Maria Sofia are in charge.</p><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source height="2000" media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A9bae3b63-a38c-4b9d-99f1-69b752ed6884?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A9bae3b63-a38c-4b9d-99f1-69b752ed6884?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A9bae3b63-a38c-4b9d-99f1-69b752ed6884?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A9bae3b63-a38c-4b9d-99f1-69b752ed6884?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=4 4x" width="3000"/><source height="2000" media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A266cf2a7-4ebc-4432-b789-fac406cb9a48?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A266cf2a7-4ebc-4432-b789-fac406cb9a48?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A266cf2a7-4ebc-4432-b789-fac406cb9a48?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A266cf2a7-4ebc-4432-b789-fac406cb9a48?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=4 4x" width="2000"/><img alt="The courtyard at Palazzo Belmonte" data-image-type="image" height="2000" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9bae3b63-a38c-4b9d-99f1-69b752ed6884.jpg?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" width="3000"/></picture><figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"><span>The courtyard at Palazzo Belmonte</span><span> </span></figcaption></figure><p>The hotel is actually a compound; garden villas containing the newer rooms, and Casa Eduardo, a three-storey townhouse neatly enclosed within Belmonte walls, which stays open in winter as a B&amp;B. The five acres of old and lovely gardens give onto a sandy beach. Bougainvillea spills down the three-storey palazzo’s walls; a dusty ficus anchors the courtyard. Dirt paths weave between groves of lemon trees, which are harvested to make the marmalades served at breakfast.</p><p>The pool – a bright-blue rectangle, tapering to an arrow at either end – is so beyond retro it’s fabulous. At the bar above it, light lunches (pastas, a few salads) are served in summer. For dinner, you’re on your own: drive to Castellabate old town, up the hill above the hotel, or stroll into Santa Maria.

The 26 rooms and suites are complemented by what feels like acres of living rooms, full of long sofas, reading nooks and card tables. Patina – actual, as opposed to aspirational – is everywhere, gleaming from the 70-year-old pale-pink ceramic tiles that still line every floor, and the burnished chestnut panels of the flawless corner bar.</p><p>The hotel was full when I stayed, but I never saw any of the restaurants close to busy. There are half again as many loungers around the huge oval pool as there are guests, and it’s the same story down at the beach club, which stretches the length of the property. Paolo Barletta and Aldo Melpignano, respectively the CEO of Santavenere’s owner Arsenale and the property’s operational partner, have their hands in some fancy places: Melpignano’s other hotel, <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.borgoegnazia.com/">Borgo Egnazia</a>, has hosted both the G7 Summit and Justin Timberlake’s wedding; Barletta owns Soho House and <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e7f3925f-2f8a-4342-ae01-f9e0e6210fee">La Minerva</a> in Rome.

An old stable building at the garden’s edge has been converted into double rooms; Coppola himself occupied one of them during my stay, and the soft peck of his laptop was occasionally audible through the open door when I passed.</p><div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="auto" data-layout-width="full-grid"><div class="n-content-layout__container"><div class="n-content-layout__slot"><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source height="7000" media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=4 4x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=5 5x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=6 6x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=7 7x" width="5250"/><img alt="The pool at Palazzo Margherita" data-image-type="image" height="7000" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7104fbfa-f7df-464f-b08e-c4a8b7de382d.jpg?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" width="5250"/></picture><figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"><span>The pool at Palazzo Margherita</span><span> <!-- -->© Gundolf Pfotenhaue</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="n-content-layout__slot"><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source height="6000" media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=4 4x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=5 5x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=6 6x" width="4500"/><img alt="A garden suite room at Palazzo Margherita" data-image-type="image" height="6000" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fabc98784-8a27-4cc6-98ee-fb3837a69106.jpg?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" width="4500"/></picture><figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"><span>A garden suite room at Palazzo Margherita</span><span> <!-- -->© Gundolf Pfotenhaue</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>That such a confabulation of old-world gentility is hidden away in such a remote little town – conjured by a famous film director and an equally famous interior designer – casts a bit of magic over this place.

The Roman hotelier Gabriele Salini, whom Petrucci brought on to oversee operations, is largely to thank for that. All the rooms showcase works by artists that Petrucci befriended in his previous life running an art festival. I slept in the one-bedroom house he renovated atop the palazzo’s roof, where he stays these days when he’s in town, accessed via a semi-concealed door (ask for the Black Suite, but be prepared to do

The hotel has gone on to become a destination for stylish Sydneysiders; cheery groups of them dining alfresco are a common sight. When I stayed it was unusually quiet, and I had Trapanà’s best things more or less to myself. The airy double living room, with its Moroccan kilims and deep white sofas, has ceilings of creamy <em>pietra leccese</em> stone. The pool is in its own walled garden, surrounded by wrought-iron lanterns. There’s a croquet pitch connected to a cactus garden.

/content/2baeefcc-aa1d-419e-beb3-c5c1f0326d09	A stale, taxing take on M&S’s viral strawberry ‘sando’	<p>One of the great things about <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/hackney-town-hall-wedding">recently getting married</a> was not having to write about the Marks and Spencer Strawberry &amp; Creme thing.</p><p>But successfully hitched and safely ensconced back at FT Alphaville Towers, we couldn’t get it out of our head.</p><p>We write “thing”, because the item — widely called a sandwich or “sando”, though not by its own box — became the focus of a burst of brief but intense UK-tax-related coverage in late June and early July, after being launched by moderately upmarket British grocer M&amp;S.</p><p>The ‘Red Diamond™ Strawberry &amp; Creme on soft sweetened bread’ (henceforth RDSC)’s general hype as a culinary arrival had a wonky sub-category. Punters, aggregators, churnalists and tax advisers all were asking whether if it were being <em>sold</em> as a sandwich — and therefore zero-rated for value-added tax — HM Revenue &amp; Customs (the UK’s tax authority) might choose to challenge that.</p><p>Some went further, suggesting a legal challenge was already under way — something for which there is no apparent evidence. See for example <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@accountant_she/video/7520945955764505878">this TikTok by user accountant_she</a>, which opens with the bold assertion that “HMRC are heading to court with Marks and Spencer over this viral sandwich”: 111k likes, presumably millions of views, questionable factual content.

City AM’s piece included comments from FTAV <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8d6413e-1184-4f89-9bcb-4f6cb8d7aad4">tax</a> <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/45486099-debf-440a-964a-cf92d7eb7e2c">coverage</a> <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3a64f96e-3214-48ba-9da4-76b3fb7ab8c1">regular</a> Max Schofield of Devereux Chambers (not the author’s former employer), but did not include a response from M&amp;S (the author’s former employer). Coverage rapidly spread, but the question either wasn’t being asked, or wasn’t being answered.</p><p><a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.milstedlangdon.co.uk/its-not-just-food-its-an-ms-vat-query/">One write-up</a>, from Milsted Langdon’s Julian Borley, said:</p><blockquote class="n-content-blockquote o3-editorial-typography-blockquote"><p>It is understood that Marks and Spencer are treating the product as being zero rated for VAT purposes as they would with any other sandwich that they sell.</p></blockquote><p>We asked Borley where this understanding came from, and he told us:</p><blockquote class="n-content-blockquote o3-editorial-typography-blockquote"><p>In writing my article I had looked through various others and I saw the comment on another source. Unfortunately, I cannot find that source now.</p><p>It is likely that most of the sandwiches that M&amp;S sell will be zero rated. However, I don’t think it can be said for certain that this product is treated as zero rated.</p></blockquote><p>It’s usually on a seller to judge whether VAT should apply to their wares, with HMRC standing by to offer (<a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/5af5b182-349a-4a25-b4fb-4551908f2b3f">sometimes unhelpful</a>) advice, and step in if they think things are being done incorrectly.</p><p>In that context, M&amp;S’s default VAT treatment is fundamental to the RDSC pseudo-debate: </p><p>— if there is no VAT, they’re probably categorising it as a cold sandwich, and there <em>could</em> be a controversy.<br/>— if there is VAT, they’re probably categorising it as confectionery, and it seems unlikely HMRC would challenge them on that (why give up tax revenue?). </p><p>Figuring out which it is (without asking the company) might have been easy. Traditionally, one way of telling whether you’ve been charged VAT on a product is to look at the receipt. If there’s an asterisk next to an item’s price, you’ve paid VAT. M&amp;S, however, <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.taxationweb.co.uk/forum/m-s-till-receipts-i-m-confused-t32011.html">seemingly doesn’t do this</a>.</p><p>Still, we wanted to check — and FTAV rarely gets to do shoe-leather tax reporting — so on Wednesday afternoon we wandered down to the nearest M&amp;S and bought <strong>FOR PRIMARILY* REPORTING PURPOSES</strong> an RDSC (VAT rating unknown), some ready salted crisps (definitely standard-rated) and a banana (definitely zero-rated). Don’t let anyone tell you journalism is easy.</p><p>One immediate discovery was that if the RDSC had ever been a sellout viral sensation in the Square Mile, that time may have passed** — the One New Change M&amp;S food-to-go fridge had dozens of 75p sandos about to pass their best-before date:</p><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source height="3002" media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ae327d9d4-5c76-4bbd-be93-43c369a10bb1?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ae327d9d4-5c76-4bbd-be93-43c369a10bb1?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ae327d9d4-5c76-4bbd-be93-43c369a10bb1?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ae327d9d4-5c76-4bbd-be93-43c369a10bb1?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=4 4x" width="3024"/><img alt="" data-image-type="image" height="3002" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe327d9d4-5c76-4bbd-be93-43c369a10bb1.jpg?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" width="3024"/></picture><figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"><span></span><span>© FTAV</span></figcaption></figure><p>A very-slightly later, more important discovery was that our receipt had no asterisks.</p><p>Having failed to do journalism the old-fashioned way, we got in touch with M&amp;S.</p><p>…who refused to tell us, or disclose whether any contact with HMRC had taken place — despite our pleading that here is a strong public interest in this case. </p><p>A source close to the company said it does not reveal this kind of detail about its products, but indicated it is seen internally as a sandwich.</p><p>We could get caught up on wondering why M&amp;S is so unwilling to share this type of information, but instead let’s just accept this issue may be shrouded in mystery for some time.</p><h2 class="n-content-heading-2 o3-editorial-typography-chapter">What do we do with this non-answer?</h2><p>Assuming the answer indeed is a sandwich, the obvious answer is this: nothing. We do nothing with it. It’s trivial. Unless HMRC decides it’s a good use of taxpayers’ money to challenge M&amp;S over this, this entire controversy exists purely in the realm of the hypothetical.</p><p>Despite that, some places have already started using the RDSC as a stick to beat VAT rules with — <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/tax-news/2025/jun-2025/new-in-the-m-and-s-foodhall-a-vat-dilemma">take for example the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</a>, whose technical manager Ed Saltmarsh says this demonstrates how VAT is “weighed-down by complexity”. We agree with the broad point, but this case doesn’t (yet) illustrate it. </p><p>Not least because IT’S CLEARLY A COLD SANDWICH.</p><h2 class="n-content-heading-2 o3-editorial-typography-chapter">OK but is it though?</h2><p>😞</p><p>Fine, let’s do this.</p><p>As mentioned above, HMRC would probably only get into a scrap with M&amp;S over this if they think the RDSC is confectionery. If it is being categorised as a cold sandwich, it would make little sense for HMRC to bother suggesting it should instead be seen as an unspecified food or conventional cake — those are also are zero-rated, so there would be no benefit to the taxman from it.</p><p>HMRC might try to frame the RDSC as the kind of <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8d6413e-1184-4f89-9bcb-4f6cb8d7aad4">problematic cake</a> we alluded to above, in an effort to bump it into confectionery.</p><p>If that were to happen, the role of the humble Victoria Sandwich would surely become crucial. It’s practically the platonic ideal of a British cake (yes, despite being called a sandwich in this sliced form), it’s more cake-like than the sando, but it’s also similar in many key ways — consisting of something creamy and something strawberry-y inside two bits of sweetened, baked carbohydrate:</p><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source height="656" media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1796c900-2218-45db-b9b1-8bf6d62f54cf?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x" width="1304"/><img alt="" data-image-type="image" height="656" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1796c900-2218-45db-b9b1-8bf6d62f54cf.png?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" width="1304"/></picture></figure><p>Surely no judge would deem that the RDSC is more confectionery-like than the Victoria Sandwich — or, even more radical, open the door to a future ruling that a Victoria sponge is not cake. Surely.***</p><h2 class="n-content-heading-2 o3-editorial-typography-chapter">Why a judge might deem that the RDSC is more confectionery-like than the Victoria Sponge</h2><p>Were this case ever to make it to a Tax Tribunal, there would probably be two significant points:</p><p>1) How the judge chooses to interpret the recurrent advice that questions of this type, as per Lord Justice Jacob’s guidance in <a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.casemine.com/judgement/uk/5a8ff7a160d03e7f57eb082a"><em>Revenue &amp; Customs v Procter &amp; Gamble UK</em></a>, call for a “short practical answer”.<br/>2) If the answer to point 1 somehow isn’t “it’s obviously a cold bloody sandwich”, the outcome of a multifactorial assessment of the product’s nature.</p><p>That assessment would involve going through a bunch of the sando’s attributes, and assessing whether they are sandwichian.</p><p>As mentioned above, Grant Thornton’s Daniel Rice has done what we think is a pretty good job at estimating how her assessment would go down, which we’ve quoted below and interspersed with our thoughts:</p><blockquote class="n-content-blockquote o3-editorial-typography-blockquote"><p><strong>Taste:</strong> It tastes of strawberries and cream and bread, unsurprisingly.

/content/56004ab5-ec90-4160-a759-d03d15f1613f	The Lionesses’ triumph is all about the money	<p>England’s second successive victory at the women’s European football championship is the result of many things: elite coaching, team spirit and a little bit of luck. But it is also a triumph of money.</p><p>Since the first women’s Euros I watched — in which England were eliminated 6-2 by Germany — the amount spent by both the Football Association and England’s elite clubs has skyrocketed. In 2009, Rachel Williams had been working full-time as a plasterer just months before the start of the tournament. Eni Aluko worked part-time as a lawyer. In contrast, in 2025, the starting XI are full-time footballers, many of them with a host of endorsements and sponsorship deals. </p><p>England is not alone in spending more money on women’s football — it’s not a coincidence that the final was between England and Spain, who also contributed the clubs (Arsenal and Barcelona) for the Champions League final a few weeks ago, which was also won by the English side. But some of the biggest clubs in world football aren’t spending more on women’s football out of a philanthropic desire to band together to beat diabetes or other ailments caused by sedentary lifestyles. It’s because they believe there is money to be made. </p><p>Previous successes have provided a downpayment on that belief. The surge in attendances after England’s victory at the Euros in 2022 now means that Arsenal’s home games in the league take place at the 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium, where the men’s team play, not the 4,500-capacity Meadow Park in London’s exurbs. The dream of football’s moneymakers — that the phrase “women’s football” might one day be as redundant as referring to “women’s tennis” when you talk about the stars of that game — looks, if not in immediate reach, to be a plausible target to aim for. </p><p>The question is whether that success will mean changing the game in ways that long-standing supporters find alienating. Football administrators have seen expanding the audience for women’s football as about targeting two groups: persuading people, largely men, with a pre-existing attachment to a football club, to attend both men’s and women’s games, and attracting people without an interest in men’s football, largely women, to games for the first time. </p><p>Significantly cheaper tickets — my season ticket is £110, behind the goal, while the same seat for the men’s game costs £1,127 — mean there are many more families with children, and often people will bring guests who support other teams. From this season, fans in certain parts of the stadium will be able to drink alcohol at their seats, which they can’t do at men’s matches. The dreaded video assistant referee (VAR), which drains some of the fun and energy out of the stadium experience, has not yet come to the women’s game. The league’s major players and struggling teams are not a carbon copy of the men’s top flight: Arsenal’s opening game this year is against the London City Lionesses, a women’s club without a male affiliate. Although England’s Premier League markets itself as “LGBT-friendly” in all circumstances, it is at women’s matches that you will see same-sex couples arm in arm, in a way that is rare in the men’s game.</p><p>That’s not to say, as some condescending coverage does, that we are all sweetness and light. One reason I like to sit, or rather stand, behind the goal is to barrack the opposition goalkeeper, and during last season, the march to the stadium was often accompanied by graffiti calling for the struggling head coach, Jonas Eidevall, to leave or be sacked. Although you can no longer make out the solitary voice of the particularly angry man who used to vent his displeasure at poor performances at Meadow Park, now when performances drop the mood in the stands can be mutinous. </p><p>But the question for long-term fans is whether the distinctive delights of the women’s game can thrive and survive alongside the game’s growth. Will my £110 ticket soon be a thing of the past? Can the game attract large crowds on a par with the men while maintaining its relaxed relationship to booze and equal love? Can it command big television audiences while the match day experience remains unblighted by VAR? Or will all these joys disappear, as have the days when you could enjoy a cup of tea, a hot dog, a chat with the catering staff and be back in the stands before the end of halftime in Meadow Park? </p><p>These questions all suggest a broader uncertainty around the women’s game: we know the reason why we are able to watch the finest generation of women’s footballers yet seen is because of more money and more interest in the game. But it remains to be seen if there is a route to the rewards and prestige enjoyed by the men’s game that doesn’t involve taking on its more dispiriting aspects. </p><p><a data-trackable="link" href="mailto:stephen.bush@ft.com"><em>stephen.bush@ft.com</em></a></p><p><strong>Letter in response to this column:</strong><br/><a data-trackable="link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/55537b57-f2ce-490a-9cc8-2155aedb9713"><em>The Lionesses’ lessons for British science / From Thomas Fink, Director, London Institute for Mathematical Sciences, London W1, UK</em></a></p>	Stephen Bush	2025-07-28 16:20:33.629	2025-08-03 18:04:20.406652	But larger crowds and bigger financial rewards could threaten what sets women’s football apart from the men’s game	{"Stephen Bush","Retail & Consumer industry",Football,"FT Edit"}	https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F0304c781-0cdb-44fe-90a7-329d82c67795.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1
